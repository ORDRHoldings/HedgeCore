# Changelog (AI-maintained)

## 2026-04-13 — Sprint 56-61: Treasury Suite Phase 1 — GL Journals, Settlement & ERP Pull

### Added
- **ADR-0009** (GL journal entry posting) + **ADR-0013** (treasury transaction spine) in `docs/architecture/adr/`
- **`JournalEntry` model** (`backend/app/models/journal_entry.py`): SHA-256 hash chain (`entry_hash`, `prev_entry_hash`, `chain_seq`), 5-state machine (DRAFT→PENDING_APPROVAL→APPROVED→POSTED/REJECTED), `before_delete` WORM hook
- **`GLAccountMapping` model**: `entry_type + standard` unique key, links debit/credit accounts to accounting standards
- **`TreasuryTransaction` model** (`backend/app/models/treasury_transaction.py`): strict WORM append-only audit spine with per-record SHA-256 hash
- **Migrations** 0014 (journal_entries + gl_account_mappings), 0015 (treasury_transactions), 0016 (settlement_events) with PostgreSQL WORM triggers
- **GL service** (`backend/app/services/gl_service.py`): `generate_journal_entries`, `approve_journal_entry`, `reject_journal_entry` with 4-eyes SoD; SHA-256 chain extension via row-level `FOR UPDATE` lock
- **v1_gl routes** (`backend/app/api/routes/v1_gl.py`): 8 endpoints (GL mapping CRUD, JE list/generate/approve/reject/post/export); plan-gated professional+
- **Posting adapters**: QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite (paper mode stub), CSV exporter — all behind abstract `GLPostingAdapter` ABC
- **`gl_posting_service`** (`backend/app/services/gl_posting_service.py`): dispatches to correct adapter by `erp_system`, enforces APPROVED-only posting
- **ERP pull adapters**: `XeroAdapter` (live pull + paper mode), `NetSuiteAdapter` (Phase 2 stub)
- **`erp_connector_service`** (`backend/app/services/erp_connector_service.py`): idempotent dedup via `Position.record_id = f"ERP-{hash[:16]}"`, filters `is_active=True` to allow reimport after soft-delete
- **v1_erp routes** (`backend/app/api/routes/v1_erp.py`): `POST /v1/erp/pull/{connector_id}` — looks up credentials from `company.settings`, triggers pull, returns result
- **`SettlementEvent` model** (`backend/app/models/settlement_event.py`): WORM with per-record `event_hash`, `before_delete` hook
- **`settlement_service`** (`backend/app/services/settlement_service.py`): `confirm_settlement` creates CONFIRMED SettlementEvent + DRAFT JournalEntry for P&L variance; tenant-scoped; graceful fallback when GL mapping absent
- **v1_settlement routes** (`backend/app/api/routes/v1_settlement.py`): pending list + confirm endpoint
- **Frontend `glClient.ts`** (`frontend/src/lib/api/glClient.ts`): type-safe client for all GL/settlement/ERP endpoints via `dashboardFetch`
- **Frontend pages**: `/settings/gl-accounts`, `/gl-postings` (approve/reject/post queue), `/settlement`, `/erp-sync`
- **AppSidebar** nav items: GL Postings, Settlement, ERP Sync (all professional-tier gated)

### Fixed
- Tenant isolation: `approve_journal_entry`, `reject_journal_entry`, `confirm_settlement` all scope DB queries by `company_id`
- `_is_duplicate` adds `Position.is_active == True` filter (prevents soft-deleted positions from permanently blocking ERP reimport)
- `gl_posting_service`: removed `session.flush()` (route owns commit, service is pure mutator)
- `XeroPoster`: stores `self.sandbox` attribute (was silently dropped)
- 502 error response sanitized to avoid leaking ERP credential fragments
- `GLMappingNotConfiguredError` NameError guard in `settlement_service` (import failure path)
- Settlement confirm modal: `entry.id` null guard before POST

### Test evidence
- Backend: **4839 passed, 158 skipped (PG-only), 0 failed** (pre-existing `test_trace_bundle_fingerprint_deterministic` ordering flake deselected)
- Frontend: `tsc --noEmit` CLEAN, `next build` PASS

## 2026-04-13 — Sprint 55: Portfolio Latency Card, Dataset Count Footer & Last-Fail Filter

### Added
- **Portfolio assessment latency card** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab card showing AVG DAYS SINCE and MEDIAN DAYS SINCE last assessment across all datasets that have runs. Optional UNASSESSED column when any datasets have never been tested. Color-coded: green ≤7d, amber ≤30d, red >30d. Median is skew-resistant vs outlier datasets.
- **Dataset coverage count in footer** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab footer stats bar gains "DATASETS N" KPI showing how many distinct `dataset_id` values appear in the current filtered run list. Hidden when ≤1 (uninteresting in single-dataset views).
- **"LAST FAIL" quick filter** (`page.tsx`): DatasetsTab toolbar red chip that filters to only datasets whose chronologically most recent run was ineffective. Self-hides when no such datasets exist in the current data. Implemented via new `dsLastFailOnly` boolean state with `reduce`-based last-run lookup.

### Test evidence
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — CLEAN (exit code 0, after fixing `datasets` scope error in RunsTab)
- HTTP 200 confirmed on all tabs
- Browser automation unavailable — marked [NOT BROWSER CONFIRMED]
  - 55.1: With 2 datasets both assessed → latency card shows avg/median. One never assessed → UNASSESSED: 1 column appears.
  - 55.2: Filter to runs across 2 datasets → "DATASETS 2" appears in footer. Filter to single dataset → hidden.
  - 55.3: Dataset with last run ineffective exists → LAST FAIL button visible. Click → only failing-last datasets shown.

## 2026-04-13 — Sprint 54: Standard Coverage Gap Card, Copy Run IDs & Dataset Risk Level Tag

### Added
- **Standard coverage gap card** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab 3-column grid showing how many datasets have been tested under each of IAS 39, IFRS 9, and ASC 815. Each column shows a mini progress bar, tested/total count, and "N untested" or "full coverage" label. Color-coded green/amber/red by coverage percentage.
- **"COPY IDS" toolbar button** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab toolbar button that copies all filtered run UUIDs (newline-separated) to the clipboard via `navigator.clipboard.writeText`. Flashes green with "COPIED!" label for 1.5 seconds after use. Hidden when `filteredRuns` is empty.
- **Per-dataset risk level tag** (`page.tsx`): DatasetsTab accordion header gains a cycling risk badge (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW → clear) stored in localStorage under `hec_ds_risk`. Clicking the faint dashed "RISK" placeholder initiates the cycle. Active badge is color-coded (red/amber/cyan). All click handlers call `e.stopPropagation()` to avoid accordion open/close.

### Test evidence
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — CLEAN (exit code 0)
- HTTP 200 confirmed on all tabs
- Browser automation unavailable — marked [NOT BROWSER CONFIRMED]
  - 54.1: With 2 datasets and 2 runs (both IAS 39) → IAS 39 shows "2/2 full coverage" green; IFRS 9 and ASC 815 show "2 untested" red.
  - 54.2: Click COPY IDS → clipboard receives 2 UUIDs separated by newline; button flashes green.
  - 54.3: Click "RISK" placeholder → badge becomes "HIGH RISK" red; click again → "MEDIUM RISK" amber; click → "LOW RISK" cyan; click → placeholder returns.

## 2026-04-13 — Sprint 53: Pass Rate Trend Card, Verdict Ratio Bar & Untested Gap Filter

### Added
- **Pass rate trend indicator** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab card showing IMPROVING ↗ / DECLINING ↘ / STABLE → by comparing the pass rate of the chronologically oldest half of runs against the newest half. Displays pp delta and per-half stats. Threshold: 5 percentage points. Guard: requires ≥4 dated runs.
- **Verdict ratio visual bar** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab 8px horizontal bar between the filter stats row and the monthly heatmap. Green segment proportional to pass count, red to fail count. Labels below show exact counts. Updates instantly as filters change.
- **"UNTESTED" gap filter** (`page.tsx`): DatasetsTab toolbar button that filters to only datasets with zero assessment runs. Styled in red when active; hidden entirely when every dataset already has runs. Implemented via new `dsUntestedOnly` boolean state applied in `filteredDs`.

### Test evidence
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — CLEAN (exit code 0)
- HTTP 200 confirmed on all tabs
- Browser automation unavailable — marked [NOT BROWSER CONFIRMED]

## 2026-04-13 — Sprint 52: Worst Performer Card, Footer Standard Breakdown & Datasets CSV Export

### Added
- **Worst performer card** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab red-styled card showing the dataset with the lowest composite score (pass rate 70% + D.O. proximity 30%), mirroring the top performer card. Only shown when ≥2 datasets have runs. Displays name, pair, fail%, avg D.O., run count.
- **Per-standard footer breakdown** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab footer stats bar gains clickable "IAS 39 N / IFRS 9 N / ASC 815 N" pills after a divider. Each pill click sets stdFilter (toggles off if already active). Hidden when fewer than 2 standards have runs in the current filtered set.
- **Datasets CSV export** (`page.tsx`): DatasetsTab toolbar "CSV" button exports the currently filtered dataset list as a CSV file with columns: name, currency_pair, hedge_type, period_count, runs, pass_rate_pct, last_assessed. Uses `URL.createObjectURL` + synthetic anchor click. Respects active search and filter state.

### Test evidence
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — CLEAN (exit code 0)
- HTTP 200 confirmed on all tabs
- Browser automation unavailable — marked [NOT BROWSER CONFIRMED]
  - 52.1: With 2 datasets (both have runs), worst performer = lower pass rate dataset → red card visible.
  - 52.2: Footer shows "IAS 39 2 | IFRS 9 1" pills. Click "IAS 39" → filter activates; click again → resets to ALL.
  - 52.3: Click CSV → downloads `datasets.csv` with 2 dataset rows and correct column values.

### Added
- **Year-to-date summary card** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab 3-column card showing YTD RUNS, PASS RATE, and AVG D.O. for the current calendar year. Each column shows the prior-year value below with a ↑/↓ delta arrow. Card hidden when no dated runs exist in either year.
- **R²-only filter toggle** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab "R² DATA" chip button that filters the run list to only rows where `regression_r_squared` is populated. Active state renders in cyan. Pill added to the active-filters bar with a clear action. Included in the `useEffect` page-reset dep array.
- **Recent runs mini-timeline** (`page.tsx`): DatasetsTab — at the top of each expanded accordion section, a horizontal strip of coloured squares (10×14px) shows the run history oldest→newest. Green = PASS, red = FAIL. Hover tooltip shows date, verdict, and standard. Up to 20 cells; shows count suffix. Renders above the edit metadata strip and last-3-runs table.

## 2026-04-13 — Sprint 50: Assessment Calendar Heatmap, OOB Badge & Compliance Sort

### Added
- **Assessment calendar heatmap** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab 12-week rolling grid. Week columns, day-of-week rows. Each cell coloured by pass outcome: green (all pass), amber (mixed), red (all fail), grey (no runs). Intensity encodes run count — darker = more runs. Month name row above the grid, DOW labels to the left. Legend row below with a "Darker = more runs" note. Anchor: today = last cell in current week column.
- **Out-of-band warning badge** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab `⚠ OOB` red badge shown when a run is marked overall_effective but its D.O. ratio is outside the 80–125% effectiveness band (ratio < 0.80 or > 1.25). Tooltip shows exact ratio. Positioned before the efficiency score badge.
- **Compliance sort** (`page.tsx`): DatasetsTab sort dropdown gains "Compliance score" option. Score formula: passRate×0.5 + recency×0.3 + sufficiency×0.2. recency = 1 if last run <7d, 0.5 if <30d, else 0. sufficiency = min(runCount/5, 1). Highest-scoring (most compliant) datasets sort first.

## 2026-04-13 — Sprint 41: Period Sufficiency Matrix, Filter Stats Row & Verdict Sparkline

### Added
- **Period sufficiency matrix** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab card showing per-dataset row with period count and colored badges for each standard (IAS 39 ≥8, ASC 815 ≥8, IFRS 9 ≥30). Green `✓` when sufficient; red `NEEDS N+` showing the shortfall. Helps treasury teams identify which datasets need more historical data before testing.
- **Filter statistics summary row** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab compact "BY STD: X N× Y%" row between filter pills and monthly heatmap. Shows per-standard count and pass rate for the currently filtered view. Guard: only shows when ≥2 distinct standards in view (otherwise redundant with existing stats).
- **Last 5 runs verdict sparkline** (`page.tsx`): DatasetsTab accordion header — row of up to 5 mini colored squares (green=effective, red=ineffective), newest first with fading opacity. Each dot has a tooltip with verdict + date. Suppressed when dataset has no runs.

### Test evidence
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — CLEAN (exit code 0)
- Browser confirmed: 2026-04-13 via Playwright
  - 41.1: Both datasets show `IAS 39 NEEDS 2+` / `ASC 815 NEEDS 2+` / `IFRS 9 NEEDS 24+` (6 periods each) (screenshot: sprint41-period-sufficiency.png)
  - 41.2: "BY STD: ASC 815 1× 100% IFRS 9 1× 100%" row visible above heatmap (screenshot: sprint41-runs-filterstats.png)
  - 41.3: Two green dots on EUR/USD Q1 2024 Test; copy dataset suppressed (no runs) (screenshot: sprint41-datasets-sparkline.png)

## 2026-04-13 — Sprint 40: Test Method Coverage, Date Presets & Assessment Frequency Badge

### Added
- **Test method coverage card** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab card showing per-standard breakdown of runs with regression analysis (R² present) vs dollar-offset-only. Progress bar per standard; color-coded: ≥50% regression coverage = green, else amber. Only renders standards that have ≥1 run. Critical for IFRS 9 compliance which requires regression.
- **Quick date range presets** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab 7D / 30D / 90D pill buttons inline in the filter toolbar. Sets `dateFrom` to N days ago and clears `dateTo` (open-ended range to today). Active preset highlighted cyan. Resets page to 1 via existing filter-change effect.
- **Assessment frequency badge** (`page.tsx`): DatasetsTab accordion metadata row shows avg run rate as "X.X/MO" when ≥1/month, or "Nd CADENCE" when less frequent. Requires ≥2 runs. Cyan badge. Tooltip shows raw counts and span.

## 2026-04-13 — Sprint 39: D.O. Band Distribution, Efficiency Score Badge & Next Assessment Due

### Added
- **D.O. ratio band distribution bar** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab full-width stacked horizontal bar showing what proportion of runs fall below band (<0.80, red), in band (0.80–1.25, green), or above band (>1.25, amber). Color-coded legend with count + percentage per segment. Positioned after compliance scorecard. Only renders when ≥1 run has D.O. data.
- **Per-run efficiency score badge** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab inline score (0–100) next to every verdict chip. Composite of D.O. proximity to 1.0 (70%) and R² (30%). Color-coded: ≥80 green, ≥55 cyan, ≥35 amber, <35 red. Suppressed when run has no D.O. data. Tooltip exposes formula.
- **Next assessment due badge** (`page.tsx`): DatasetsTab accordion metadata row shows due/overdue status based on 30-day recommended cadence.

## 2026-04-13 — Sprint 38: Top Performers Panel, Page Size Selector & Health Score Badge

### Added
- **Top performing datasets panel** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab card ranking top 3 datasets by pass rate (min 2 runs each). Shows rank #1/#2/#3 badges, pass rate progress bars, effective/total counts, avg D.O. ratio. Guard: hidden when no dataset has ≥2 runs. Positioned before Assessment Velocity card.
- **Dynamic page size selector** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab PER PAGE toggle (25 / 50 / ALL) rendered bottom-right above pagination. Active selection highlighted cyan. `pageSize` state (25|50|0); 0 = show all. `PAGE_SIZE` constant moved after `filteredRuns` declaration to avoid reference-before-definition error. Resets to page 1 on change.
- **Dataset health score badge** (`page.tsx`): DatasetsTab accordion header composite badge (0–100). Formula: pass rate 40pts + recency 30pts (decays over 90 days) + run volume 20pts (capped at 5 runs) + drift stability 10pts. Tiers: A≥80 (green), B≥60 (cyan), C≥40 (amber), D<40 (red). Tooltip exposes formula. Hidden for datasets with no runs.

## 2026-04-13 — Sprint 37: Compliance Scorecard, Summary Footer & Staleness Badge

### Added
- **Compliance scorecard table** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab 3-column grid card showing COMPLIANT / NON-COMPLIANT / NOT TESTED status for IAS 39 / IFRS 9 / ASC 815. Status derived from most-recent run verdict per standard. Each cell also shows pass rate %, run count, and last assessment date. "NOT TESTED" surfaces untested standards — critical for coverage visibility. Renders when ≥1 total run exists.
- **Filtered-runs summary footer** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab slim bar beneath the run list (above pagination) showing aggregate stats for currently visible (filtered) runs: EFFECTIVE count, PASS RATE, AVG D.O. (green when in-band), AVG R². Label changes from "ALL N RUNS" to "FILTERED N RUNS" when filters are active. Always visible when filteredRuns.length > 0.
- **Dataset staleness badge** (`page.tsx`): DatasetsTab accordion header shows an age badge after the verdict chip: amber `Nd AGO` for 7–29 days since last assessment, red `Nd STALE` for ≥30 days. Suppressed when <7 days (fresh) or no runs for dataset.

## 2026-04-13 — Sprint 36: Assessment Velocity Card, Multi-Standard Breakdown & Help Overlay

### Added
- **Assessment velocity card** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab full-width card showing LAST 7 DAYS / LAST 30 DAYS / AVG/WEEK run counts plus a CADENCE badge (STABLE / ACCELERATING / DECELERATING) computed by comparing run counts in the most-recent 4-week window vs the prior 4-week window. Renders when ≥2 runs exist.
- **Multi-standard breakdown table** (`page.tsx`): DatasetsTab accordion expanded section shows a card-grid (one card per standard) with pass rate %, effective/total count, and average D.O. ratio when a single dataset has runs recorded under ≥2 different accounting standards. Guard: `stdKeys.length < 2` suppresses the table for single-standard datasets — correct behavior with test data.
- **Keyboard shortcut help overlay** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab `?` toolbar button plus `?` key (when no input focused) toggles a bottom-right-anchored panel listing ↑↓/Enter/Space/Esc/? shortcuts as styled `<kbd>` chips. Backdrop click and Esc both dismiss. Implemented in a dedicated `useEffect` separate from the existing keyboard navigation handler.

## 2026-04-12 — Sprint 35: Currency Pair Panel, Active Filter Pills & Dataset Rank Badge

### Added
- **Currency pair distribution panel** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab full-width card showing currency pairs grouped from all runs, sorted by run count descending, with animated pass rate progress bar per pair (green ≥80%, amber ≥60%, red <60%) and effective/total label. Null `currency_pair` renders as "MULTI".
- **Active filter pill bar** (`page.tsx`): RunsTab contextual row rendered below the toolbar when ≥1 filter is non-default. Cyan chips for: search text, standard, verdict, tag, starred-only, date-from, date-to, D.O. min, D.O. max. Each chip has × button to clear its own filter. CLEAR ALL button appears when ≥2 chips present. Hidden entirely when no filters active.
- **Dataset-relative rank badge** (`page.tsx`): Per run row in flat view, shows `#1 BEST` (green) / `#2` (cyan) / `#3+` (gray) badge indicating run's rank within its dataset by D.O. proximity to 1.00. Pre-computed via `dsRunGroups` + `dsRankMap` inside flat-view IIFE (O(n log n) total, O(1) per row). Badge suppressed when dataset has <2 runs.

## 2026-04-12 — Sprint 34: Effectiveness Regime Bar, Enhanced CSV Export & Run Age Display

### Added
- **Effectiveness regime bar** (`page.tsx`): OverviewTab horizontal stacked bar showing consecutive runs of identical effectiveness verdict as colored segments (green=effective, red=ineffective). Flex proportional widths — no fixed-pixel math. Past segments at 30% opacity; current segment full opacity. Count label inside each segment when >8% of total width. CURRENT badge shows `EFFECTIVE ×N` or `INEFFECTIVE ×N`. OLDEST ← → LATEST footer labels. Only renders when ≥2 runs.
- **Enhanced CSV export** (`page.tsx`): `handleExportCsv` now includes `note` and `tag` columns after `created_at`. Note field properly RFC 4180 double-quote escaped (`replace(/"/g, '""')`). Tag rendered as plain string (no quoting needed). Header updated accordingly.
- **Human-readable run age** (`page.tsx`): `showAge` boolean state + `runAge(dateStr)` utility function cascading through s/m/h/d/w/mo/y tiers from elapsed milliseconds. Date cell is now clickable — `onClick` toggles `showAge`. Column header label switches between `DATE` and `AGE` to reflect current mode. `e.stopPropagation()` prevents row selection on click.

## 2026-04-04 — Sprint 6: Regulatory Reporting (IFRS 9 / ASC 815) — session 2

### Fixed
- **PageShell-inside-RunsTab bug** on `hedge-effectiveness/page.tsx`: `<PageShell>` and `Play` were imported but PageShell wrapped RunsTab content incorrectly. Removed both imports and the erroneous wrapper.

### Added
- **At-risk hedges monitor** in `OverviewTab`: surfaces hedges whose effectiveness ratio is within 10% of the IFRS 9 boundaries (0.80 lower / 1.25 upper); amber warning card with ratio + trend indicator.
- **Methodology & Standards disclosure panel** in `ComplianceSection` (EVIDENCE tab) on run detail page: shows accounting standard, methodology version, dollar-offset test pass/fail, regression test pass/fail, hedge type, designation date; includes standards citations (IFRS 9.6.4.1 / ASC 815-20-25).

## 2026-04-04 — Production Auth + Dashboard Fixes

### Fixed
- **`/auth/me` → 401 / dashboard black screen**: Schema drift — ORM model columns existed in code but not in the production PostgreSQL DB. `users.ui_preferences` and 5 `companies` columns (`sso_provider`, `sso_domain`, `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_subscription_id`, `plan_tier`) were absent. SQLAlchemy `SELECT *` failed with `UndefinedColumnError` → broad `except Exception` swallowed it as 401 → `fetchMe()` returned null → `user=null` → dashboard `return null` (black screen).
- **`_ensure_tables()` gap**: Added `ALTER TABLE` statements for all 6 missing columns. Column additions are now applied on every Render restart (idempotent `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`). Alembic migrations 0012 + 0013 created as canonical schema records.
- **`User.ui_preferences` deferred**: Marked as `deferred()` in ORM so it is excluded from the default `SELECT` even before the column is added to the DB.
- **`/auth/me` exception handler**: Changed broad `except Exception → 401` to return HTTP 500 with exception type, so DB errors are distinguishable from JWT auth failures.
- **Dashboard `toFixed` crashes**: `rate.bid/mid/ask` can be null when market data is unavailable. Guarded all 6 `.toFixed()` call sites with `?? 0`. Made `fmtUsd()` accept `null|undefined`, returning `"—"` instead of crashing. Guarded `hedgeCoverage` and `hedge_ratio` null cases.

### Browser confirmed
- Login → `/dashboard` navigates correctly
- `/auth/me` returns HTTP 200 with user, roles (63 permissions), company context
- "Good morning, Demo" greeting visible; sidebar, KPI strip, TradingView chart all render
- Zero JS errors, no error boundary triggered
- Page sweep: dashboard, hedge-desk, audit-lab, sandbox, reports all OK

## 2026-03-28 — Sprint 4: Compliance Pipeline

### Added
- **SOC2 Evidence Table**: `compliance_evidence` WORM table (DB-level NO UPDATE/DELETE triggers); nightly export job at 02:00 UTC collecting `user_count`, `policy_change_count`, `failed_auth_count` per tenant
- **SOC2 Controls Matrix**: `docs/compliance/soc2-controls-matrix.md` — CC6/CC7/CC8/CC9/A1/C1 mapped to existing controls
- **GDPR Anonymisation Job**: nightly at 01:00 UTC; SHA-256 hashes email + full_name for accounts older than `GDPR_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 730 days); row retained for WORM FK integrity
- **GDPR Data Rights**: `GET /v1/user/data-export` (Art. 15), `DELETE /v1/user/account` (Art. 17 erasure via anonymisation)
- **GDPR DPA Document**: `docs/compliance/gdpr-dpa-status.md` — sub-processor DPA status, data flows, retention schedule
- **PostgreSQL RLS**: `backend/app/core/rls.py` — `inject_tenant_rls()` uses `SET LOCAL` (transaction-scoped, safe with async connection pool); Alembic migration `k1a2b3c4d5e6` adds RLS policies on `positions` and `calculation_runs`
- **`get_session_with_rls` dependency**: composite FastAPI Depends() that injects tenant context before yielding session
- **Vendor Security Registry**: `docs/compliance/vendor-registry.md` — 10 vendors with data classification, DPA status, fallback plans
- **DB migrations**: `j1a2b3c4d5e6` (compliance_evidence), `k1a2b3c4d5e6` (RLS policies)

### Test evidence
- Backend: 4767 passed, 0 failed, 158 skipped

### Human actions required
- Sign WorkOS DPA before enabling SSO for enterprise clients

- Add `GDPR_RETENTION_DAYS` env var to Render if non-default retention needed

---

## 2026-03-28 — Sprint 3: SSO + Billing

### Added
- **WorkOS SSO**: `POST /auth/sso/callback` — exchanges WorkOS code for ORDR JWT; `sso_provider` + `sso_domain` on Company model; SSO users get stub password `!sso-no-password!`
- **Stripe billing**: `POST /v1/billing/webhook` — handles `invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.deleted`; STRIPE_LIVE_MODE gate; `stripe.api_key` set at startup
- **Plan enforcement**: `require_plan_tier()` FastAPI dependency (starter=0, professional=1, enterprise=2); raises HTTP 402 if company tier is below required minimum
- **Self-service signup**: `POST /v1/signup` — atomically creates Company + admin User + GENESIS audit event in one transaction; 409 on duplicate email
- **GENESIS hash chain**: `provision_tenant()` passes `prev_event_hash="0"*64` to first audit event; verified by integration tests in `test_genesis_hash_chain.py`
- **Frontend signup wizard**: `/signup` — 3-step wizard (company name -> credentials -> success); calls `POST /api/v1/signup`
- **Scalar API docs**: `GET /docs` — Scalar OpenAPI reference UI pointing at `/openapi.json`
- **DB migration**: `h1a2b3c4d5e6` — adds `sso_provider`, `sso_domain`, `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_subscription_id`, `plan_tier` to `companies` table

## 2026-03-27 — Operations hardening: 16 gaps closed (commits 1a09c88–eba3fe9)

### Summary
Closed 16 identified operations gaps across CI/CD, backup automation, disaster recovery, monitoring, developer documentation, database maintenance, and local infrastructure. Coverage gate raised from 40% to 60% (actual 75%). All 17 plan tasks executed via subagent-driven development with spec review.

### Changes
- **CI/CD**: gitleaks secret scan job, Dependabot (pip/npm/actions), Trivy container CVE scan, coverage gate 40%→60%
- **Backup**: `scripts/backup/pg_backup.sh` + `restore_verify.sh` with size validation and table checks
- **Docs**: `backup-restore.md` (RTO=4h/RPO=24h), `disaster-recovery-plan.md` (5 playbooks), `sla-slo.md`, `monitoring-setup.md` (UptimeRobot+Sentry), `onboarding.md`, `incident-postmortem-template.md`, `data-retention-policy.md`, `db-maintenance.md`
- **Infra**: `infra/docker/docker-compose.yml` rewritten (postgres+backend+frontend dev stack), `frontend/Dockerfile` replaced (multi-stage Alpine), `output:standalone` added to `next.config.js`

### Deferred
- S-01 secret rotation (operator action), C-04 mypy hard gate, I-01 Render blueprint sync

---

## 2026-03-25 — Infrastructure hardening + live market data fix (commits d1af599–b8db71f)

### Summary
Two-session run. Resolved 11 architectural audit issues (hardening branch → master), fixed production market data pipeline, stamped production DB, and added cold-start mitigation.

### Key Fixes
- **`fix(middleware)`**: `/api/v1/market-data/live/*` added to public_prefixes in APIKeyAuthMiddleware. Was returning 401, silently falling back to exchangerate-api.com. Now live via TwelveData: EURUSD 1.1564, USDJPY 159.35, USDMXN 17.78.
- **Production DB stamp**: `alembic_version` → `2026_03_24_baseline` via direct psql (PYTHONPATH conflict with D:\StopMug forced bypass).
- **`infra(render)`**: `hedgecore-keepalive` cron — pings `/api/health` every 14 min, prevents free-tier cold-start 503s. Activate via blueprint sync.
- **Governance files committed**: `policy_rules.py` (22 SIG_* constants) + `test_kernel_governance.py` (18 tests).
- **ordr-market**: Chart engine refactor + indicators (ADX, Bollinger, Ichimoku, RSI, Supertrend, VWAP, Volume Profile).

### 11 Hardening Issues (all resolved)
1. DDL-as-code → Alembic migrations, 31-model env.py
2. Seed user rehash → bcrypt verify-before-hash
3. Deprecated `@app.on_event` → lifespan context manager
4. Alembic baseline migration created and stamped in prod
5. SQLite backdoor → WARNING log + ALLOW_INDICATIVE_FALLBACK=false in prod
6. CORS localhost → removed from production
7. Free-tier cold starts → keepalive cron (RISK-INF-01, severity MEDIUM)
8. OpenAI phantom dep → commented out
9. Redis fallback → startup observability logging
10. Tenant isolation → 18 tests (cross-tenant, SoD)
11. synex-kernel → removed from requirements.txt (private, not on PyPI)

### Test Baseline
4684 passed, 0 failed, 156 skipped

### Sprint: Live Market Data Integration — 4/7 complete
- Done: #3 sandbox autofill, #4 TwelveData wired, #5 dashboard FX verified, #6 frontend-v2 (no-op)

## 2026-03-19 — Option A: Watchlist Backend Persistence + WebSocket Ticker (commit 05b4a00)

### Summary
Full-stack Option A complete. Watchlists now backed by PostgreSQL (`user_watchlists` table) with owner-scoped CRUD API. Frontend WatchlistsTab rewired to backend-first load with localStorage fallback and debounced save. New `useMarketTicker` WebSocket hook delivers live bid/ask/mid ticks from `/ws/market` with auto-reconnect. Build verified, 10 files changed, 651 insertions.

### Changes
- **`backend/app/models/user_watchlist.py`** (NEW): UserWatchlist model — UUID PK, user_id FK w/ CASCADE, name (unique per user), symbols (JSON), timestamps. SQLite-compat JSON type.
- **`backend/app/api/routes/v1_watchlists.py`** (NEW): CRUD router at `/v1/watchlists`. GET (list), POST (create, 409 on dupe), PUT (update symbols by ID), DELETE (404 on miss). Owner-scoped; symbols normalized to uppercase.
- **`backend/app/main.py`**: DDL for `user_watchlists` table (JSONB, UUID PK, user FK, index) added to `_ensure_tables()`.
- **`backend/app/api/router.py`**: Registered `v1_watchlists_router`.
- **`frontend/src/lib/hooks/useMarketTicker.ts`** (NEW): WebSocket hook — derives wss:// URL from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, subscribes/unsubscribes symbol delta on change, reconnects after 3s, returns `TickMap` (bid/ask/mid/ts per symbol).
- **`frontend/src/app/market-intelligence/page.tsx`**: Passes `token` prop from `useAuth()` to `WatchlistsTab`.
- **`frontend/src/app/market-intelligence/components/tabs/WatchlistsTab.tsx`**: Full rewrite — backend-first load, localStorage fallback, background create if no server watchlists, debounced 800ms PUT save, `SyncBadge` (SYNCED/LOCAL), live price strip with ticks in symbol pills.

## 2026-03-18 — UI Polish: TradingView, Login Dark Theme, Particle Fix (commit ce9e7ef)

### Summary
Three frontend UX improvements. Dashboard Market Pulse now features a TradingView Advanced Chart with FX news feed. Login page stripped of all blue accents — now black on dark gray. Particle animation calmed from jittery to smooth drift. 152 lines changed. Build: 0 errors.

### Changes
- **`dashboard/page.tsx`**: Replaced 6-column FX rate card grid with 2-column layout: TradingView Advanced Chart widget (left, 420px, interactive watchlist for 6 FX pairs) + compact rate cards (right, 300px). Added TradingView Timeline widget for live FX news & analysis (340px). Added `useRef` import, `TradingViewChart` and `TradingViewTimeline` inline components.
- **`auth/login/page.tsx`**: Changed design tokens — `accent` from `var(--accent-cyan)` to `#888888`, `accentHover` to `#999999`, `accentGlow` to `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)`, `borderFocus` to `#555555`, `panelAlpha` to `rgba(10,10,14,0.97)`. Buttons now `#1a1a1e` with `1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` border. Top accent line uses white gradient. Particle config: speed 2.2→0.5, saturation 72→0, connectionDist 145→120, lineOpacity 0.28→0.12, hueSpeedMultiplier 5→0, hues monochrome.

## 2026-03-18 — Mission Control Dashboard Upgrade (commit a38be03)

New `WidgetState` interface with `fetchWidgets()` fetching 6 endpoints via Promise.allSettled. Market Pulse: 6-column FX rate grid + macro indicator row. Operations: 2-column grid with Recent Runs table (5 rows) + Pipeline Status (Sandbox→Staging→Ledger). Team Activity: timeline with status dots, module tags, timestamps.

## 2026-03-18 — Admin Hub Command Center Upgrade

### Summary
Transformed admin hub into a modern professional command center with data presentation features. 742 lines of new/changed code across 7 files. Tests: 4602 passed, 0 failed. TypeScript: 0 errors.

### Backend changes
- **`v1_admin_metrics.py`**: Added `prev_period` block to GET /v1/admin/metrics — compares current window to same-length prior window (signups, DAU, calc_runs, audit_runs).
- **`v1_devops.py`**: Added `done_count` scalar to /v1/devops/status response — fixes frontend sprint progress always showing 0%.
- **`v1_admin_users.py`**: Added `POST /v1/admin/users` endpoint — superuser-only user creation (email, password, full_name, is_superuser, company_id). Returns 409 on duplicate email.

### Frontend changes
- **`MetricsTab.tsx`**: Added `TrendBadge` component (▲/▼/— with %) on all 4 trending KPI cards (signups, active users, calc runs, audit runs). 4-column KPI grid with 28px numbers. Enhanced conversion funnel: 32px gradient bars with overlaid labels + `▼ N pp drop-off` rows between steps.
- **`DevOpsTab.tsx`**: Fixed hardcoded `doneCount = 0` bug — now uses `data.done_count ?? 0`. Added `done_count?` to DevOpsData interface.
- **`UsersTab.tsx`**: Added `CreateUserModal` — email, password, full_name, superuser toggle. "+ CREATE USER" button in toolbar. POSTs to `/v1/admin/users`, prepends created user to list.
- **`RolesTab.tsx`**: Added `EditPermissionsModal` for non-system roles — full permission checklist pre-populated from current role. PUTs to `/v1/admin/roles/{id}/permissions`. "EDIT PERMISSIONS" button in right pane header, hidden for system roles.

## 2026-03-18 — Market Data TwelveData Fallback: Risk ID-2 mitigated (commit 905ef79)

### Summary
Backend live market data routes now fall back to TwelveData when IBKR is disabled (production). Previously all 5 endpoints returned 503 in production. Now: IBKR (primary) → TwelveData (institutional fallback) → 503. Tests: 4602 passed, 0 failed.

### Changes
- **`backend/app/api/routes/v1_market_data_live.py`**: Added `_get_td_provider()` lazy-init singleton. All data endpoints (fx-rates, equity-quotes, quote, fx-change) now try IBKR first, fall back to TwelveData if IBKR disabled or fails. `source` field in response reflects active provider (`"ibkr"` vs `"twelvedata"`).
- **`backend/tests/test_market_data_live.py`**: Updated all test patches to use `_get_ibkr_provider` (was `_get_provider`). Added `_td_provider` reset in fixture. Added `test_twelvedata_fallback_when_ibkr_disabled` test. Updated behavior tests: provider fail → 503 (was 502) since fallback chain exhausted. 26 tests, all passing.

## 2026-03-18 — Regulatory Reporting Fix: Risk ID-5 mitigated (commits c955f0e..b85a6c6)

### Summary
EMIR/MiFID II/Dodd-Frank exports now read real LEI data from company settings instead of hardcoded "NOT_PROVIDED". Added full regulatory settings UI. Tests: 4601 passed, 0 failed.

### Changes
- **`backend/app/api/routes/v1_regulatory_settings.py`** (new): `GET /v1/settings/regulatory` + `PATCH /v1/settings/regulatory` — reads/writes `company.settings["regulatory"]` JSONB (no migration). Returns `lei_configured` derived flag.
- **`backend/app/api/routes/v1_reports.py`**: `_build_reg_run_data()` made async, now queries company for LEI. All 3 callers (emir, mifid, dodd-frank) updated.
- **`backend/app/api/router.py`**: Registered `v1_regulatory_settings_router`.
- **`frontend/src/app/settings/types/settings.ts`**: Added `REGULATORY` tab to union, TABS, and HASH_MAP.
- **`frontend/src/app/settings/page.tsx`**: Wired `RegulatorySettingsTab`.
- **`frontend/src/app/settings/components/tabs/RegulatorySettingsTab.tsx`** (new): LEI form with 3 LEI inputs, venue code, framework checkboxes (EMIR/MIFID2/DODD_FRANK), financial counterparty toggle, status banner (green/amber), save button.
- **`frontend/src/app/reports/components/tabs/RegulatoryTab.tsx`**: LEI status banner above run selector — amber warning with link to settings when unconfigured, green badge when ready.

Added 4 new test files covering dashboard routes, engine modules, auth routes, and policy service. 3901 passed, 0 failed, 66% coverage.

### Changes
- **`tests/test_dashboard_routes.py`** (39 tests): dashboard summary, recent-runs, pending-approvals, team-activity, aggregate — auth rejection + happy paths + helper unit tests
- **`tests/test_engine_coverage.py`** (165 tests): `strategy_selector.py` helpers (`_as_*`, `_clamp01`, axis helpers, `select_strategies`) + `instrument_catalog.py` validators and models
- **`tests/test_auth_coverage.py`** (21 tests): register validation, login failures, refresh bad token, `/me` auth checks, logout
- **`tests/test_policy_service_coverage.py`** (19 tests): get_active_policy, list_revisions, activate_policy, create/update/delete template, deactivate

### Note
Engine agent surfaced pre-existing bug: `strategy_selector.py` references `DisclosureCode.DISCLOSED_AXIS_ALIAS_MAPPING` which doesn't exist in the enum — any alias-mapped axis call raises `AttributeError`. Flagged, not introduced.

## 2026-03-18 — Test Suite Hardening (commit f083b1d, pushed to master)

### Summary
Resolved 22 cross-test contamination failures. Test baseline: 3658 passed, 0 failed, 150 skipped (PG-only), 64% coverage. Coverage risk mitigated.

### Changes
- **`backend/tests/conftest.py`**: Added `reset_rate_limiter_state` autouse fixture — traverses `app.middleware_stack` to find `RateLimitMiddleware` instance and clears `_buckets` before/after each test. Fixes spurious 429 contamination across test files.
- **`backend/tests/test_report_studio_governance.py`**: Fixed 9 hardcoded `FXDemo` absolute paths → `TreasuryFX`. Tests had been copied from sibling project without updating paths, causing `FileNotFoundError` on all 34 governance assertions.
- **`backend/tests/test_security_config.py`**: Fixed `parents[3]` → `parents[2]` for repo root resolution. `.gitignore` lives at `TreasuryFX/` (2 levels up from tests/), not `HedgeCalc/` (3 levels).

### Validation
- Full suite: `3658 passed, 0 failed, 150 skipped in 22s`
- Coverage: 64% (up from 59%, risk ID 3 mitigated)

## 2026-03-18 — Audit Lab UX Overhaul (6 commits, pushed to master)

### Summary
Complete UX overhaul of the Audit Lab section — rebuilt as a trust-building first-impression surface for prospective clients. Six chunks delivered via subagent-driven development with two-stage spec + quality review per chunk.

### Changes
- **`frontend/src/lib/fixtures/audit-lab-demo.ts`**: Enriched `DEMO_DATASET` — markupByMonth (3 months), 11 transactions with `spread_classification`, 3 findings, 3 trustSignals; `getDemoCounterpartyStats()` helper
- **`frontend/src/app/audit-lab/demo/page.tsx`**: Rebuilt from 80→230 lines — six-act narrative: hero h1, 4-cell KPI strip, MarkupByMonthChart (ECharts, SSR-safe dynamic()), CounterpartyMatrix callout, findings with SevBadge, trust rail, CTA → signup/login, disclaimer
- **`frontend/src/app/audit-lab/upload/page.tsx`**: Added `downloadSampleCsv()`, `lastYearPeriod()` helpers; sample CSV download button; renamed progress steps; hidden UUID; benchmark tooltip; enriched upload success banner
- **`frontend/src/app/audit-lab/page.tsx`**: Removed BETA badge; datasets empty state with guided "Upload" CTA + "See a sample result" link; run list shows source filename + period + row count from `datasetMap`
- **`frontend/src/app/audit-lab/runs/[run_id]/page.tsx`**: 5-KPI grid, export hierarchy (Board Summary primary / Evidence Binder secondary / XLSX tertiary), SHA-256 hash badge (12-char preview + full title), expandable findings rows with `React.Fragment key`, Verification tab with tamper-evident context block
- **`frontend/src/components/layout/AppSidebar.tsx`**: "Activity Log" label (was "Audit Trail") to fix naming collision with governance `/audit-trail`
- **`frontend/src/app/audit-lab/audit-trail/page.tsx`**: Title/heading renamed to "Activity Log"; breadcrumb updated

### Validation
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — EXIT:0 (clean)
- `npx next build` — all pages compiled successfully
- Pushed: `bd39911..dfbc180` → origin/master (7 commits including frontend-v2 deletion)

## 2026-03-15 — Simulation Lab Live Data Wiring

### Summary
Fixed the Simulation Lab (`/sandbox`) to use live market data from the app's actual data sources instead of static BIS/EOD hardcoded values.

### Changes (commit bd39911)
- **`frontend/src/app/sandbox/page.tsx`**:
  - Fixed critical GET→POST bug in `useLiveSpot`: was calling `GET /api/market-autofill` (405 always) — changed to `POST` with JSON body
  - Extracted `fetchLiveMarket(currency, tradeDates)` helper: calls `POST /api/market-autofill` returning full `LiveMarketData` (spot + forward_points + provider_metadata)
  - `handlePairChange`: now async, injects live market snapshot into `CalculateRequest` before dispatching to engine
  - Auto-run effect: fetches live market before initial calculation, falls back to demo fixtures only if API unreachable
  - `liveRefreshed` effect: silently re-runs calculation when live data arrives after render if result used fallback data
  - Compliance badges: IFRS 9 now tied to actual `coverageRatio` (80–125%), others show grey until calculation runs, MiFID II RTS 25 reflects actual live data status

### Data Flow (after fix)
`POST /api/market-autofill` → IBKR `GET /v1/market-data/live/fx-rates` (primary) → exchangerate-api.com (fallback) → BIS demo (last resort)
Forwards: Finnhub CME futures (primary) → carry-differential estimate (fallback)
Injects: `market.spot_rate`, `market.forward_points_by_month`, `market.provider_metadata` into `CalculateRequest` before `POST /sandbox/calculate`

- **`frontend/src/app/admin/components/tabs/TenantsTab.tsx`** (new): Tenant list, create modal (auto-slug, 400 inline error), edit drawer, SUSPEND confirm
- **`frontend/src/app/admin/components/tabs/RolesTab.tsx`** (new): Two-column RBAC catalog, permission groups, create role modal with checklist
- **`frontend/src/app/admin/components/tabs/ApiKeysTab.tsx`** (new): Create/revoke flow with show-once token + COPY, audit log, DELETE 204 handling

- **`frontend/src/app/admin/components/tabs/ConfigTab.tsx`** (new): 4 independent sections (feature flags, maintenance mode, rate limits, CORS) with IN-MEMORY badges + per-section SAVE
- **`frontend/src/app/admin/components/tabs/DevOpsTab.tsx`** (new): Sprint progress, risk heat map, architecture freeze, sessions, decisions, validations — 30s auto-refresh
- **`frontend/src/components/layout/AppSidebar.tsx`**: Admin nav updated to `/admin`
- Deleted: `frontend/src/app/admin-monitor/`, `frontend/src/app/devops/`

### Backend tests (5 commits)

## 2026-03-15 — Governance Section UI/UX Overhaul

### Summary
Fixed broken layouts across all 5 governance pages (Staging Queue, Ledger, Run Viewer, Position Lineage, Hedge Wiki).

### Commits: 76aa215
- **`frontend/src/app/staging/page.tsx`**: Removed outer flex wrapper, added noPadding + refresh + cross-links
- **`frontend/src/app/ledger/page.tsx`**: Complete rewrite — inline-styled table, PASS/WARN badges, cross-links

- **`frontend/src/app/hedgewiki/page.tsx`**: Fixed outer div, updated breadcrumb to Governance

---

## 2026-03-15 — Audit Lab POST /runs HTTP 500 Fix

### Root Cause
- asyncpg infers `TIMESTAMPTZ` OID for `market_snapshots.as_of` column; passing Python `str` values for `buffer_start`/`buffer_end` raises `DataError: invalid input for query argument $2: expected datetime.date, got 'str'`

### Fix (5 commits: a0ca117, 26b9c1a, 77ca4ed, 3abd259, 30b3c6f)
- **`v1_audit_lab.py`**: Pass `buffer_start`/`buffer_end` as `datetime.date` objects (removed `str()` wrapping); added `CAST()` for all UUID/JSONB params in `audit_runs`, `audit_findings`, `audit_reports` INSERTs; `create_audit_run` thin wrapper + `_create_audit_run_inner` for error surfacing
- **`test_audit_lab_upgrade.py`**: `inspect.getsource(_create_audit_run_inner)` instead of wrapper
- **`main.py`**: Debug exception handler (reverted to safe form in final commit)

### Validation
- 442/442 audit_lab tests pass (`python -m pytest tests/ -k audit_lab -q`)
- Render deploy pending manual trigger

## 2026-03-15 — IBKR Gateway Live Data + WebSocket Streaming for ORDR Market Charts

### IBKR Real-Time Data Pipeline (ordr-market)
- **`backend/app/services/market_stream.py`** (new): `MarketStreamManager` singleton — dedicated IB connection (clientId+20), IBKR `reqMktData` streaming via `pendingTickersEvent`, fallback to 1.5s snapshot polling if Gateway unreachable
- **`backend/app/api/routes/v1_ws_market.py`** (new): Public WebSocket at `/ws/market` — subscribe/unsubscribe/ping protocol, 30s keepalive
- **`backend/app/api/router.py`**: Registered WS router
- **`backend/app/main.py`**: Stream manager shutdown wired into lifespan finally block
- **`ordr-market/src/hooks/useMarketWebSocket.ts`** (new): Frontend WS hook — auto-reconnect (3s), symbol re-subscribe without reconnect, `ws://`↔`wss://` auto-derived from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- **`ordr-market/src/components/workspace/ChartCore.tsx`**: Replaced mock data generator with real IBKR data — `usePublicChartData` for historical OHLCV bars, `useMarketWebSocket` for live tick updates to last bar
- **`ordr-market/.env.local`** (new): `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`
- **NEXUS** (ordr-market): First-time init — 28 tables, 8 agents, genesis seeded

### Test Evidence
- Backend: `3545 passed, 0 failed` (excl. 2 pre-existing unrelated failures)
- TypeScript: `tsc --noEmit` clean

## 2026-03-14 — IBKR Paper Trading + Colorful Login (commit 732b2a0)

### IBKR Integration (ADR-0005)
- **IBKRExecutor service** (`ibkr_executor.py`): ib_insync-based FX order execution with connect/disconnect, contract resolution cache, MKT/LMT orders, fill-wait with timeout, batch execution
- **3 API endpoints** (`v1_ibkr.py`): GET /v1/ibkr/status, POST /v1/ibkr/connect, POST /v1/ibkr/execute
- **PhaseExecute rewrite**: Removed Live Market Snapshot section, added IBKR execution flow with confirmation overlay, fill tracking, weighted avg price, auto-HEDGED position marking
- **ADR-0005**: Documents broker execution exception for paper trading (v1 freeze extension)
- **56 new tests**: 35 executor service + 21 route tests, all passing

### Login Page
- **Colorful particle field**: useParticleField hook extended with HSL color-shifting mode (treasury pastels: cyan, blue, lavender, teal, rose, mint), sinusoidal oscillation between white and accent hues
- Login page canvas opacity 0.6→0.7, saturation 35, lightness 86

## 2026-03-14 — Deep Security Audit: Admin + Hedge Desk + Pipeline (commit af2357a)

### Admin Section (10 criticals fixed)
- **Unauthenticated DB wipe**: `seed-companies` gated behind `require_superuser` + production env block
- **WORM compliance**: Removed DELETE/TRUNCATE on audit_events, calculation_runs, policy_revisions
- **Credential leak**: Stripped plaintext passwords from seed response
- **API key creation**: Delegated to service with proper Argon2id hashing (was missing secret_hash)
- **API key auth escalation**: Replaced `validate_api_key` with `require_superuser` on management endpoints
- **Dual Base class**: `api_key_audit.py` now uses `app.core.db.Base` (was invisible to migrations)
- **Token version**: JWT `ver` claim now validated in `get_current_user` — forced logout works
- **Auth consolidation**: 3 files fixed to import `get_current_user` from `dependencies.py` (not `security.py`)
- **Frontend auth gates**: admin-monitor + devops pages guard data fetches before superuser check

### Hedge Desk Pipeline (5 criticals fixed)
- **Tenant isolation**: `company_id` column added to `proposals` + `ledger_entries` tables
- **Scoped queries**: `list_proposals`, `get_proposal`, `list_ledger`, `get_ledger` all filter by tenant
- **RBAC**: All proposal + ledger endpoints now require permission checks

### Hedge Desk Workflow (6 high fixes)
- **Data flow**: `calcResult` stores full object (marketSnapshot no longer lost between phases)
- **Currency**: PhaseExecute extracts currency from bucket dynamically (was hardcoded MXN)
- **CME_SPECS**: Consolidated into shared `tokens.ts` (was duplicated in Review + Execute)
- **Execution safety**: Confirmation overlay before irreversible HEDGED marking
- **Hash chain**: Pipeline events query prev hash per-tenant (was always GENESIS_HASH)
- **Terminal guard**: Block field mutations on HEDGED/REJECTED positions

### Backend Hardening (3 high fixes)
- **Dual-key**: Removed route-layer override — service is single source of truth
- **Governance default**: `"solo"` → `"team"` (fail-closed SoD)
- **DB models**: `__import__` hack removed, int→UUID FK types fixed, Float→Numeric for monetary columns

### Evidence
- 95 new tests across 6 test files
- 3475 backend tests passed, 134 skipped, 0 failed
- Frontend TypeScript clean, build passes
- 35 files changed, +2015 -206 lines

## 2026-03-14 — Marketing Site Redesign: Tailwind + SVG Diagrams (commit 88af206)
- **Full redesign**: Replaced inline-style C/F theme system with Tailwind CSS classes and enterprise grid aesthetic.
- **Home page**: 12 sections with 3 inline SVG diagram components (SvgArchitecture 3-layer platform, SvgHashChain WORM audit blocks, SvgPillars 5 infrastructure pillars).
- **Custom CSS**: `bg-grid`/`bg-grid-dark` patterns, `section-label` with `::before` dash, `mkt-card` hover top-border animation, `status-dot` with `pulse-dot` keyframe.
- **Nav rebuild**: Products/Solutions mega-dropdowns with icons, ORDR Market removed as standalone link (only in Products dropdown). Mobile overlay simplified.
- **Footer rebuild**: 5-column dark layout (brand+status, products, solutions, company, legal) with external link support.
- **Secondary pages**: About (Engine/AI panels, Core Values, Numbers Strip), Contact (form+cards+system status), Products index (2-col grid with AI Boundary boxes).
- **Product CTAs**: All "Get Started" → "Request Demo", /auth/login → /contact across 5 product detail pages.
- **Layout**: MarketingLayout simplified (no C/F imports), theme.ts preserved for product detail backward compat.
- 15 files changed, +889 -1630 lines (-741 net).

## 2026-03-13 — ORDR Market Embedded Mode + Workspace Refactor (commit 99ef12b)
- **ChartEngine embedded mode**: 12 new props for external config sync (indicators, sub-panes, chart type, drawing mode, magnet/hide/lock/delete-all).
- **Theme**: `syncThemeWithCSS()` for CSS variable integration.
- **priceLine**: New `drawIndicatorLegend()` for sub-pane indicator labels.
- **IndicatorsPanel**: Expanded with category groups and search filtering.
- **WorkspaceProvider**: External state management for embedded chart integration.
- **ChartCore/CommandBar**: Refactored for workspace integration, simplified rendering.
- 16 files changed, +1056 -733 lines.

## 2026-03-13 — Professional FinTech Marketing Website (commit 7bb2a2d)
- **Landing page**: Complete rewrite with 10 animated sections — ticker tape, metrics counters, scroll-triggered animations, hero gradient, feature grid, use cases, CTA.
- **7 product pages**: Treasury, Market, Portfolio, Labs, Polisophic, HedgeWiki, FinHub — each with hero, animated metrics, feature cards, use cases, CTA.
- **6 solution pages**: Corporate Treasury, Risk Management, Asset Management, Banking, Insurance, Energy — industry-specific content with relevant product mapping.
- **Pricing**: 3 tiers (Essentials $299/mo, Professional $799/mo, Enterprise custom) with feature comparison and FAQ.
- **About**: Company story, leadership team (4 executives), values section.
- **Contact**: Form with role selector + contact info cards.
- **Shared infra**: `MarketingLayout` (nav+footer wrapper), `MarketingNav` (529L, product/solution dropdowns, mobile hamburger, theme toggle), `MarketingFooter` (271L, 5-column layout), `theme.ts` (DARK/LIGHT presets, fonts), `useMarketingTheme` hook.
- **ClientProviders**: `/products`, `/solutions`, `/pricing`, `/about`, `/contact` added as public route prefixes.
- **Fix**: React hooks rules violations — `useCounter` in `.map()` callbacks replaced with `MetricCounter` component across all 7 product pages.
- 25 files changed, +5647 -420 lines.

## 2026-03-13 — Report Studio: Formal Narratives + Library Bridge (commit bb0c613)
- **Library → Studio bridge**: Fixed dead `onSelectPreset` callback — clicking a preset in Library now loads it into Studio tab via `pendingPresetId` state.
- **Narrative engine**: 7 generators producing multi-paragraph institutional prose (executive summary, exposure, hedge efficiency, scenario, compliance, VaR, hedge accounting).
- **NarrativeSection component**: Shared renderer with type-coded left borders (OVERVIEW/ANALYSIS/FINDING/METHODOLOGY/RECOMMENDATION/DISCLAIMER).
- **Enhanced panels**: 5 report panels now render narrative sections below existing metrics.
- **Tests**: 135+ new tests — 65 unit (reportCalcs), 40 narrative, 30+ workflow.

## 2026-03-13 — UIUXSRC Portable Design System (commit bae6972)
- **New package**: Created standalone `UIUXSRC/` design system — portable, framework-agnostic UI component library.
- **7 theme presets**: Treasury Dark, Midnight, Slate, Arctic, Bloomberg, Nord, Solarized — all with CSS variable tokens.
- **13 components**: Button, ActionButton, Card, KpiTile, KpiStrip, StatusChip, EmptyState, Spinner, Icon, PageHeader, PageShell + ThemeProvider + contrast validator.
- **Integration guide**: `CLAUDE.md` (253 lines) with usage patterns, token reference, component API docs. `README.md` with quick start.
- **Design tokens**: `tokens.ts` (centralized S object), `globals.css` (341 lines of CSS variables), WCAG contrast validation utility.
- **Research**: `UIUX Research/` added with deep-research-report.md + Treasury Software Color Theme Research.docx.
- 20 new files, +2595 lines. No build impact (standalone package).

## 2026-03-13 — Stale Route Cleanup (commit 4458175)
- **Fix**: Updated 8 files with dead references to `/market-overview` and `/fx-market` after page deletion.
- **Files**: dashboard/page.tsx, help/page.tsx, Nav.tsx, DashboardHelpPanel.tsx, CommandHubWidget.tsx, QuickActionsWidget.tsx, ClientProviders.tsx, helpContent.ts.
- All routes now point to `/market-intelligence` with appropriate tab params.

## 2026-03-13 — Unified Market Intelligence Dashboard (commit 243febf)
- **Consolidation**: Replaced 3 disconnected market pages (`/market-intelligence`, `/market-overview`, `/fx-market`) with single tabbed Market Intelligence Dashboard at `/market-intelligence`.
- **6 tabs**: Overview (5-layer command page: ticker tape, hotlists, heatmap, calendar, breadth, sectors, technicals, news), Heatmap (full-viewport with Stocks/ETFs/Forex/Crypto selector), Calendar (economic events), Companies (symbol search + overview + technicals), Watchlists (localStorage persistence + screener + mini charts), Signals (passive technicals grid + news stream).
- **New components** (17 files): `TradingViewWidget.tsx` (generic script-injection embed wrapper), `MarketTabBar.tsx`, `MarketControlBar.tsx`, `types.ts`, 5 overview sub-components (LeftColumn, CenterColumn, RightColumn, BelowFoldModules, MarketPulseStrip), 6 tab components (OverviewTab, HeatmapTab, CalendarTab, CompaniesTab, WatchlistsTab, SignalsTab).
- **Sidebar**: MARKET section updated from 3 separate items to 6 tab-linked items, prefixes narrowed to `["/market-intelligence"]`.
- **Deleted**: `market-overview/page.tsx`, `fx-market/page.tsx`.
- **Build**: PASS (next build clean). No backend changes.

## 2026-03-12 — ORDR Market Workspace Redesign (ordr-market/)
- **Full UI rebuild**: Replaced dark-theme top-bar + raw ChartEngine mount with institutional light-theme trading workstation shell
- **New workspace/ layer** (4 files, 1,485 lines): `tokens.ts` (design system), `primitives.tsx` (7 atomic components), `MockCandleChart.tsx` (Canvas 2D chart), `ChartWorkspace.tsx` (shell assembly)
- **Layout**: 40px top bar · 40px left drawing rail (20 tools) · flex chart canvas · 40px right utility rail · 28px bottom strip — chart occupies ~88% viewport
- **Design system**: Cool neutral palette (`#F0F3FA` / `#FAFBFE`), muted blue/salmon candles, Inter + JetBrains Mono fonts, token-driven spacing/radii/shadows
- **Canvas chart**: 250-bar mock OHLCV, 7px narrow candles, S/R dashed levels, ghost watermark, price/time axes, volume zone, ResizeObserver responsive
- **Interactive states**: Hover/active on all buttons, floating drawing palette on draw-mode activation, paper trading toggle, timeframe + chart-type selectors
- **Build**: Clean — 0 TS errors, 0 warnings. Merged PR #1 → master. Deployed to Vercel (auto).

## 2026-03-09 — Audit Lab Canonical Truth Pass
- **Reclassification**: Prior "37/40 production-ready" claim corrected to conservative truth: 3/40 OPERATIONALLY PROVEN, 33/40 CODE COMPLETE (synthetic data only), 3/40 PARTIAL, 1/40 STUB/BLOCKED.
- **Mandatory downgrades**: Items 5 (source-inspection test), 21 (programmatic XLSX), 22 (mocked pdfplumber), 25 (hand-crafted SWIFT fixture), 26 (synthetic forward points), 37 (unvalidated ISDA/FINRA schemas) → CODE COMPLETE. Item 29 (benchmark provider never imported) → STUB/BLOCKED.
- **P3 reclassified**: Document parsing foundation, not OCR-grade document intelligence.
- **P6 reclassified**: Regulatory format stubs, not schema-validated compliance exports.
- **Canonical truth memo**: `docs/audits/2026-03-09-audit-lab-canonical-truth-memo.md`
- **State files corrected**: CURRENT_STATE.md inflated claims removed, new HIGH risk added for real-data gap.

## 2026-03-09 — Audit Lab Blocker Fixes + P4 Pipeline Integration + 1-to-1 Audit
- **Blocker: Regulatory export** — ISDA XML now loads actual transactions from audit_transactions (not findings), builds proper SELL/BUY trade legs, includes `<auditSummary>` section with findings count/total. FINRA 17a-4 field mappings fixed (finding_id, timestamp, category, severity, description).
- **Blocker: Review queue** — Backend `GET /review-queue` endpoint returns low-confidence transactions (confidence < 0.8) with RBAC `audit.review` permission. `POST /review-queue/{id}/resolve` supports approve/reject/correct (WORM-safe append). Frontend fully upgraded from stub run-list to functional confidence-based review interface with KPIs, filter tabs, color-coded confidence cells, approve/reject buttons.
- **Blocker: Run detail response** — Now returns `rate_variance_results`, `counterparty_scores`, `natural_hedges`, `outlier_count` from report_json (was missing analytics fields).
- **Blocker: Trends endpoint** — Now includes `counterparty_breakdown` aggregate for frontend trend dashboard.
- **P4 Item 26 (Forward Points)** — `forward_points` field on BenchmarkEntry, applied in `_compute_markup()` when `value_date != trade_date`.
- **P4 Item 27 (Intraday)** — `trade_time` field on AuditTransactionInput (structural only, no hourly matching logic).
- **P4 Item 28 (Cross-Rate)** — `_synthesize_cross_rate()` wired into `_compute_markup()` as fallback before rejection. Synthetic benchmarks tagged `SYNTHETIC_CROSS`.
- **P4 Item 30 (Size Normalization)** — `size_adjusted_markup_bps` on MarkupFinding, computed during markup analysis against 3-tier expected spreads.
- Tests: +53 new (20 P4 engine + 33 review queue/regulatory). Total: 3157 passed, 134 skipped, 0 failed. Frontend build clean.

## 2026-03-09 — Audit Lab Production Hardening Sprint
- **Dataclass fix**: `spread_classification` field moved after required fields (Python dataclass ordering rule)
- **SQLite compat**: bid_rate/ask_rate benchmark query wrapped in try/except fallback
- **RBAC permissions**: 4 new permissions registered (audit.review, audit.export, audit.schedule, audit.benchmark_fetch) + role mappings for supervisor/risk_analyst
- **Analytics wiring**: `_detect_outliers()`, `_score_counterparties()`, `_detect_natural_hedges()` now called inside `run_audit_engine()` with results stored in `AuditEngineResult`
- **Finding persistence**: OUTLIER findings now persisted to audit_findings WORM table; report JSON includes analytics data
- **Rename**: `UnhedgedImpactResult` → `RateVarianceResult`, `UNHEDGED_IMPACT` → `RATE_VARIANCE` finding type, `total_unhedged_impact_usd` → `total_rate_variance_usd` — all with `@property` backward compat aliases
- **Exposure gap**: pair normalization fixed (alphabetical sort, not concatenation order)
- **Pydantic schemas**: Updated with rate_variance, analytics fields, backward compat
- **Frontend**: Run detail page updated for rate_variance + analytics types
- **Tests**: +53 upgrade tests (RBAC, exposure gap, spread classification) + 35 parser fixture tests with real sample files
- Validation: 3104 passed, 134 skipped, 0 failed. Frontend build clean.

## 2026-03-09 — Audit Lab Institutional Upgrade (40 items, P0-P6)
- **P0 Foundation** (Items 1-7): Alembic migration with FK constraints + 4 composite indexes on audit tables. ORM models for 5 audit tables (`audit_lab.py`). Batch INSERT replacing per-row loop. Date range filter ±30 days on market_snapshots. 10MB file size limit. Admin metrics `uploaded_by→created_by` + status case fix. Benchmark staleness limit (7-day default, configurable).
- **P1 Markup Methodology** (Items 8-13): Signed markup (removed `abs()`) with ADVERSE/FAVORABLE/AT_MARKET direction. Bid/ask columns on market_snapshots (migration + model).

## 2026-03-08 — Policy Engine Post-Reconstruction Hardening (7 phases)
- **Phase 1** (forward curves): Created `forward_curve_service.py` + `v1_forward_curves.py` — 4 RBAC-gated endpoints (POST create, GET by id, GET latest/{pair}, GET pair/{pair}). Hash-idempotent CRUD, 24h staleness evaluation (V-023), data provenance classification (LIVE/DELAYED/INDICATIVE/SYNTHETIC). Tests: hash determinism, staleness, provenance validation.
- **Phase 2** (wizard deepening): Extended `policy-ai/route.ts` AI system prompt with `extended_policy` schema (6 sections: volatility, scenarios, decision_gate, netting, instruments, effectiveness). Added response parsing with validation/clamping (lookback_days [20,252], var_confidence [0.90,0.99], max_cost_bps [25,150]). Output now ExtendedPolicyConfig-level, not preset-shaped.
- **Phase 3** (volatility overlay): Created `vol_overlay.py` (Layer 2) — band widening by vol regime (LOW=0.9, NORMAL=1.0, ELEVATED=1.15, CRISIS=1.30), ratio adjustment (clamp cur/base [0.85,1.15]), region-aware fallback vols (G10=8%, EM_LATAM=14%, EM_ASIA=10%, EM_CEEMEA=16%). Created `volatility_snapshot_service.py` + `v1_volatility_snapshots.py` (3 endpoints). 24 tests: parity (4), regime (7), widening (5), adjustment (6), fallbacks (5).
- **Phase 4** (geopolitical overlay): Created `geo_overlay.py` (Layer 3) — linear ratio haircut when corridor risk score exceeds escalation threshold (default 0.7, max haircut 10%). Created `geo_snapshot_service.py` + `v1_geo_snapshots.py` (4 endpoints). 26 currency pairs mapped to geopolitical corridors. 18 tests: parity (4), corridors (4), haircut math (6), application (3), active overlay (4).
- **Phase 5** (backtesting): Created `backtesting.py` — deterministic single-period evaluation (hedged/unhedged PnL, effectiveness, cost), multi-period backtest with max drawdown + aggregate metrics, policy comparison with recommendation. SHA-256 report hash. All labeled `grading: 'HEURISTIC'`. 13 tests: period eval (5), multi-period (5), comparison (2), edge cases (1).
- **Phase 6** (netting overlay): Created `netting_overlay.py` (Layer 6) — same-pair/same-flow-type netting (conservative), cross-flow netting (aggressive, opt-in), savings tracking (~3% margin savings Almgren-Chriss estimate), legs eliminated tracking. 12 tests: parity (4), netting (7), active overlay (2).
- **Phase 7** (governance hardening): Wired `apply_second_approval()` in execution_proposal_service — enforces SoD (second approver ≠ maker AND ≠ primary checker), chained hash linking to approval_hash. Added `_determine_second_approval_required()` ($1M threshold). Added dual-key gate in `execute_approved_proposal()`. Created 15 dual-key E2E tests + 12 multi-tenant isolation tests.
- **Route registration**: All 3 new route modules registered in `api/router.py` (219 total routes).
- **Whitepaper**: Created `overlay-activation-contracts.md` — activation contracts for all overlays with parity proofs, fallback behavior, grading labels.
- **Overlay parity**: ALL overlays neutral by default (disabled). When disabled: multipliers=1.0, adjustments=[], haircut=0.0, exposures pass through. v1 parity mathematically preserved.
- Net: +2400 lines new code, +119 new tests. 13 new files created, 4 existing files modified.
- Validation: 2725 passed, 134 skipped, 0 failed. Frontend build clean.

## 2026-03-07 — Hedge Desk institutional redesign (Phase D)
- **D1** (nav cleanup): Removed WorkflowBreadcrumb + WorkflowGuide from run mode — both were hardcoded to step 1, never updated. ProgressBar is now single authoritative progress model with phase-aware instruction text. Reclaimed ~68px vertical space.
- **D2** (visual unification): Created `tokens.ts` shared design token file. Eliminated PhaseReview's hardcoded Bloomberg-dark palette (14 hex colors). All 7 phase files + ProgressBar now import from shared CSS-variable tokens. Zero hardcoded dark colors remain.
- **D3** (Step 2 rebuild): PhaseCalculate expanded from thin confirmation to "Prepare & Calculate" — exposure narrative, market context interpretation, post-calc recommendation preview (coverage/cost/legs), assumptions block, consequence-of-inaction note. No longer auto-advances after calculation.
- **D4** (Step 3 rebuild): PhaseRisk expanded — 5-constraint evaluation manifest with per-check PASS/FAIL, governance implications (solo vs 4-eyes), quant panels wrapped under "Quantitative Risk Analysis" header. SMB auto-skip now shows visible banner before advancing.
- **D5** (Step 4 rebuild): PhaseReview restructured as Decision Room — Decision Thesis at top (plain-English recommendation), compact step header replacing heavy identity bar, CME specs + audit provenance made collapsible, enhanced CTA with contextual info.
- **D6** (Step 5 reframe): PhaseExecute reframed as "Execution Confirmation" — pre-confirmation checklist, improved disclaimer framing, post-execution warning, CTA shows leg/contract counts.
- **D7** (Step 6 rebuild): PhaseComplete restructured — compact confirmation banner replacing giant checkmark, 3-path next actions (Monitor/Export/New Run), export options consolidated into dropdown card, reduced from 8 buttons to 3 cards.
- Net: +1660 lines, -917 lines across 10 files. 1 new file (tokens.ts).
- Validation: tsc --noEmit clean, next build success, 2444 backend tests passed (0 failed).
- Commit: 8360648

## 2026-03-07 — Hedge Desk redesign: Phases A + B + C
- **Phase A** (foundation): hedgeErrors.ts error translation, ErrorBanner.tsx, draftPersistence.ts, safeFetch wrapper in dashboardClient, EmptyState session-expired/network/no-permission states
- **Phase B** (navigation): AppSidebar simplified Hedge Desk section (6 items), HedgeDeskOverview landing page, dual-mode page.tsx (overview vs run), WorkflowBreadcrumb 6-step strip, WorkflowGuide step-of-5 bar, HedgeDeskPipeline draft persistence + goBack
- **Phase C** (pipeline unification): All 5 steps unified with consistent UX
  - Step 1 PhaseSelect: 3-tab intake (existing/manual/upload), shared basket, "STEP 1 OF 5" header
  - Step 2 PhaseCalculate: summary cards, unified action bar, "STEP 2 OF 5"
  - Step 3 PhaseRisk: verdict card with accent border, "STEP 3 OF 5"
  - Step 4 PhaseReview: targeted edits — step numbering, duplicate button removal, action bar
  - Step 5 PhaseExecute: step header, back moved to action bar
  - PhaseComplete: CSS variable tokens, completion header strip, inline audit trail
- Committed in 4 logical chunks: OS framework → Phase A → Phase B → Phase C
- Validation: tsc --noEmit + next build both pass clean

## 2026-03-07 — Phase 2 hardening: truth reconciliation + invariant enforcement
- Fixed 16 contradictions/stale claims across state files, MEMORY.md, CHANGELOG, rules
- Corrected DB_CANON.md: 31 → 35 DDL tables, fixed table name mismatches
- Added core/security.py to freeze guard (was in rules but not enforced)
- Upgraded freeze guard: 3-level (hard freeze + content invariant guards + warn-only)
- Invariant guards: WORM trigger removal blocked, SoD/auth edits warned
- Leaned prompt injection: max 1 rule, 20 lines, word-boundary matching (was 2 rules, 40 lines)
- Leaned SessionStart: 12 lines / 572 chars (was 27 lines / 842 chars)
- Added /done skill (completion discipline with evidence chain)
- Added /reconcile skill + scripts/reconcile_truth.py (truth alignment checker)
- Cleaned memory.db: removed test artifacts, seeded work_items, recorded validation
- Trimmed MEMORY.md: 188 → 82 lines, fixed all stale counts/names
- Closed OS Bootstrap sprint, opened Phase 2 Hardening sprint (8/8 done)
- Reconciliation result: 16 aligned, 0 stale, 0 contradictions
